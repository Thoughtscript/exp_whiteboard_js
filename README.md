# EXP_WHITEBOARD_JS

An experiment to get more acquainted with the [Canvas API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) (I was looking into this a long time ago and wanted to revisit this topic).

I was also concerned by the lack of simple drawing tools and found the following example inspiring: https://github.com/os1ma/handwriting-canvas/blob/main/LICENSE. Whole companies and websites have launched to do this kind of thing and I was surprised at how easy it is to implement from scratch.

Good to practice proper Library and SDK design.
